    """
    Identify deceleration event given time series of 
    zonal mean zonal wind for a specific level, and
    given criteria
    
    Identification criteria:
        - over the e.g. 10-window there's a deceleration 
        - the deceleration is over the specified value (drop)
        - after an identified event, another event is only identified e.g. 20 days later (nxtevnt)
        - in the 10 days moving window after an event, if the next identified event is stronger 
          than the first identified event, pick the stronger event in the window
        - the ratio between the maximum wind change in the event window
          to the identified wind change for the given event window
          has to be less 1.2, to avoid identifying with variations that
          is much shorter than the event window, e.g. 10 days
    
    Inputs:
        U_data (array)         - time series of u1060
        U_time (datenum array) - datenum of the period of the data
        drop (float)           - wind change threshold over the specified event window (wdw) to exceed such that an event is considered (units: m/s per day) 
        nxtevnt (int)          - number of days after the last identified event to identify the next
        wdw (int)              - window width of events
        mode (str)             - 'decel'/ 'accel' to identify wind deceleration/ acceleration events
    
    Outputs:
        onset_nums (array) - numbers specifying the onset date of the event (convert to date using num2date) 
        drop_vals (array)  - values of the drop in wind, (first - last day)
